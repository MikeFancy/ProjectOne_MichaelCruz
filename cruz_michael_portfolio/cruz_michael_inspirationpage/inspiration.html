                <h3>Kim Jung Ji is a Graphic Illustrator that is best known
                    for his technical drawings and not using any reference
                    to draw any kind of figures. He is my inspiration due to
                    the his methods of drawing and having his way of imagining
                    all of his drawings come to life by having it look more
                    realistic. I have always aspired to draw like him, and to
                    implement it in my everyday life.

            <h2><em> Saul Bass</em></h2>

                <h3>Saul bass is a Graphic Designer that makes movie posters
                    such as movies from the 1970s to the early 90s. He is one
                    of my inspirations due to his art style and how he utilizes
                    geometric shapes and expressing his emotions and movies 
                    through that. Lastly, Saul Bass' work ethic and how much he
                    puts out media and new graphic posters has been inspiring, and
                    I always aspire to put out any kind of content that I could be
                    proud of.

            <h2><em>Keith Haring</em></h2>
            <img src="img/keithharingimage Small.png" alt="keith haring posing with his art work">
                <h3>Keith Haring is a graphic designer and an Illustrator that is
                    based in New York, and his art pieces are mostly social commentary
                    about various topics, and is best known for their figure drawings.
                    I really like how simple yet so effective his drawings are, and it
                    even reached to pop culture and has the influence around the world,
                    working with artists and even working with well known companies.
