            <h2>I am a graphic designer, San Francisco based, and been designing for
            more than 3 years now, and have experience with designing posters,
            social media content, tattoo designing, and developing more UI work.
            For the kinds of softwares I use, I have some experience in Adobe
            Suite, using ProCreate, Canva, and lately been using a little of Figma.
            For my free time, I would not only be sketching, but I also listen to
            music at the same time.
