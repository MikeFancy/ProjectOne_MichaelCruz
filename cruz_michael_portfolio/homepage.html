        I am a graphic designer, San Francisco based, and been designing for
        more than 3 years now, and have experience with designing posters,
        social media content, tattoo designing, and developing more UI work.
        For the kinds of softwares I use, I have some experience in Adobe
        Suite, using ProCreate, Canva, and lately been using a little of Figma.
        For my free time, I would not only be sketching, but I also listen to
        music at the same time.
